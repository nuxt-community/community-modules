> Prepack is a tool that optimizes JavaScript source code: Computations that can be done at compile-time instead of run-time get eliminated. 
> Prepack replaces the global code of a JavaScript bundle with equivalent code that is a simple sequence of assignments. 
> This gets rid of most intermediate computations and object allocations. ([more info](https://prepack.io))
